Clívia is an innovative **Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution focused on medical clinics**, working to revolutionize patient support and sales. Launched as part of the Agent Brasil project, an initiative by Sandeco, Clívia was conceived by João Pedro, with experience in business and digital marketing in the medical field, and Thiago, an AI specialist and researcher. They combined their expertise to develop a system that not only optimizes processes but also enhances human work in clinics.

## The Latent Problem in Medical Clinic Management

With **over 5 years of experience and more than 100 clinics served** in marketing and sales consulting, the team behind Clívia identified significant pain points in the sector. Clinics often depend on **word of mouth, which is unpredictable**, and contacts generated by marketing are not always ready to buy, requiring efficient support and sales processes.

**Medical secretaries** face an **overload of administrative tasks**, such as issuing invoices, payment control, and serving coffee, dedicating **only about 30% of their time to sales activities**. This results in:

- **Lack of standardization and agility in support**
- **Difficulty applying developed commercial processes**, leading to low lead conversion (many clinics convert only 3-5% of interested parties into appointments, against a target of 10%)
- **Absence of supervision** in support quality
- **Loss of leads** that "cool off" due to delayed response
- **Doctors, often not trained in management**, don't have time or knowledge to supervise the support sector, which directly impacts billing
- **High secretary turnover** due to the stressful nature and low compensation of the work

## The Clívia Solution: Smart Sales with AI Agents

Clívia was developed as a **multi-agent system** to qualify leads and optimize the entire support and sales process. Its proposal goes **beyond a common chatbot**, seeking humanized support focused on results.

### Main Clívia Features:

**Fast and Humanized 24/7 Support:** Clívia converses with patients, identifying needs and scheduling appointments directly in the medical calendar. Unlike traditional bots, it generates connection with the customer.

**Lead Qualification and Objection Handling:** Through strategic questions, the AI identifies the patient's potential and uses scripts to handle common objections (such as "it's expensive").

**Doctor and Clinic Presentation:** It highlights the professional's differentiators (education, achievements) and the clinic. Clívia also **scans the client's website and social media**, sending relevant materials to convince the patient.

**Strategic Sales Follow-ups:** Clívia performs automatic contacts with patients who didn't respond, following a validated process of messages at specific intervals.

**CFM Compliance:** The AI is 100% aligned with Federal Council of Medicine standards, avoiding sensationalism or unvalidated information.

## Transformative Benefits for Clinics and Patients

Clívia implementation results in significant gains:

- **Secretary Time Liberation:** By automating repetitive support, Clívia allows secretaries to dedicate more time to high-value tasks
- **Conversion and Billing Increase:** With standardized, agile, and sales-focused support, Clívia aims to **increase lead conversion rate to scheduled appointments to at least 10%**
- **Team Stress Reduction:** Decreases secretary work overload, especially during peak hours
- **Constant and Standardized Support:** Ensures all patients receive quality support, even outside business hours

## The Technology and Security Behind Clívia

Clívia is built with a **robust and scalable architecture**, using **Python** and frameworks like Crew, Link Graph, and LangChain for agent orchestration. It operates with a self-scalable cloud system to ensure 100% effectiveness.

To **prevent "hallucinations" and ensure response accuracy**, Clívia uses:

- **Guard Rails:** Limits imposed on AI so it doesn't provide dangerous or incorrect information
- **Judge Agents:** Other AI agents monitor and validate Clívia's responses before they reach the user
- **LLM Ops and Observability:** Tools to measure AI call effectiveness and monitor agent behavior in real-time

**General Data Protection Law (LGPD)** is a priority, with Clívia **anonymizing data** when communicating with APIs and **never impersonating the doctor**, but rather presenting itself as "Clívia, the attendant".

## Future Vision and Evolution

Clívia developers already have ambitious plans for the future:

- **Audio Responses:** Implement the ability to respond with audio, including cloning the secretary's or doctor's voice
- **Own CRM:** Develop an exclusive Clívia CRM system for automatic sales funnel filling
- **Medical Records Integration:** Connect to medical records to access patient history
- **Task Management:** Facilitate return scheduling and other tasks with patients
- **Support for Other Channels:** Expand support to Instagram

Clívia is focused on serving own medical practices with a lean structure, offering a simplified pricing model, without complex technical terms like "tokens".

For those seeking to optimize support, increase sales, and free up the medical team's precious time, Clívia emerges as a **powerful and intelligent solution**. The experience at Campus Party Brasília, where it attracted great interest from health professionals, reinforces the potential and relevance of this solution for the market.
