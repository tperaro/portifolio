    subtitle: How I see the future of technology
    text: >
      I believe in AI’s transformative power when applied ethically and
      responsibly. My work always seeks balance between technological
      innovation and positive social impact.


      In Sobrevidas, for example, we built a solution that can save lives by
      enabling early diagnosis of oral cancer. At Clivia, we create tools that
      humanize medical care through technology.


      As a community leader, I promote networking and collaboration, believing
      innovation emerges from knowledge exchange and shared experiences. I
      advocate for ethical AI and building technology that benefits society.
